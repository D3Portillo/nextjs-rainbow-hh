## NextJS + Tailwind + Hardhat + RainbowKit Starter

First, run a new hardhat node chain

```
npx hardhat node
```

In another console do:

```
npx hardhat deploy
```

The above will start a chain locally(hardhat chain) and deploy to local. We can now use our frontend in local and test in "hardhat" chain.

> Remember to npm install
